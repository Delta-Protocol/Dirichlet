- file Connect bug: shift with computed lhs miscalculated
- allow unequal sized numbers, e.g. when adding
- add allocator to radix32-integer
- process both roots during a single pass
- combine small factors when sieving into a single pattern

- add "right justify" method to IntegerMath

- try log(2 * x * sqrt(n)) as the cutoff: http://www.crypto-world.com/documents/contini_siqs.pdf
- convert to "round" instead of "cieling" for LogScale
- try sieving for 2 with a large number
- port multiplier code from msieve

- don't sieve for factors of multiplier (investigate first)
