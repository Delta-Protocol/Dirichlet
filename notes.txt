- file Connect bug: shift with computed lhs miscalculated
- allow unequal sized numbers, e.g. when adding
- add allocator to radix32-integer
- process both roots during a single pass
- combine small factors when sieving into a single pattern

- add "right justify" method to IntegerMath

- try log(2 * x * sqrt(n)) as the cutoff: http://www.crypto-world.com/documents/contini_siqs.pdf
- convert to "round" instead of "cieling" for LogScale
- try sieving for 2 with a large number
- port multiplier code from msieve

- don't sieve for factors of multiplier (investigate first)
- for q[l], polynomial(x) | q[l] iff x = -c (2 b)^-1 mod q[l]
- fix ModularSquareRoot mod 2 if value is even, more generally if value mod modulus == 0

f(0) = -1
f(-1) = 1
f(1) = 1

f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c

f(0) = -1 = c
f(-1) = 1 = a - b + c
f(1) = 1 = a + b + c

c = -1

a - b - 1 = 1
a + b - 1 = 1

a - b = 2
a + b = 2

2 a = 4
a = 2
b = 0

f(x) = 2 x^2 - 1

f(x) = (ax + b)^2 - n

- merge add relation and create relation
- write integer mod/pow
